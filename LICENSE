Basically, just don't be a jerk. If you take a piece of code and improve on it, let me know and credit the original. Arts, textures, sounds, whatever - credit and remix if you want.
I really don't know enough about licenses to make an informed decision here so just stick with don't be a jerk and follow the general ideas of open source.

Some assets listed below were either heavily inspired by or taken from (consenting) projects:
* The class literally called MathCrap (honestly mojang, so much of this should be there already!) was alrgely adapted from Mithion's Ars Magica 2
* The tree related math classes were taken from https://github.com/abego/treelayout after I struggled to adapt an improved version of Walker's algorithm on my own (WIP - may eventually be replaced by my own, I'd really like to figure that out)
